# Reflection for CP1404

## Shreya Ranjan

Estimates - The estimates that I predicted before writing the program more or less became accurate as the course
progressed as I was better able to grasp concepts and apply them. This practice of using estimates, I felt, is essential
when programming in order to give oneself a target and discipline oneself to finish within a particular time frame.

Code Reviews - I enjoyed doing code reviews for others. But, for most of my practicals, I did not receive any code review. For the
other 2 practicals for which I received a comment, it was only that my program is good. Nonetheless, I thoroughly 
enjoyed the process of helping others improve on their code. This also helped me realise the mistakes that I can make in
my code and even helped me notice the things I had done correctly.

What I would change - I think this module is well-structured and no change is required.
