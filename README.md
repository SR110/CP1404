# Programming II (CP1404) Practicals

## Shreya Ranjan

As a person who loves to explore the field of coding, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of sculpting this repository from
the clay of variables, functions and classes. I hope you enjoy going through my code as much as I enjoyed writing it!
This repository contains all the Practical Work from Programming II (this is part of the JCU CP1404 Module)

Lessons I have learned about "clean code":

1. Keep meaningful variable/class/function names - keep names such that the reader is easily able to understand the
   code, without doing any guesswork.
2. Break the code into chunks (functions) - this will reduce the effort of the programmer by allowing him/her to use the
   functions instead of rewriting code. This will also increase readability of code for those who read it.
3. Use proper formatting - format the code with the correct indentation, spacing and line breaks. Try to also neatly
   format and display the output of the code.
